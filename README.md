# Welcome to CytoData Hackathon 2021! 

Welcome to Cytodata Hackathon 2021. Grab a cup of your favourite drink and join us in a journey that will bring you to learn new skills, make new friends and put your quantitative skills to the test while dealing with an interesting challenge in stem cells.

<br/>

Pluripotency is the capacity of certain stem cells to give rise to virtually any cell of the body. Pluripotent cells can be taken from the early stages of development or induced through transduction of specific transcription factors (reprogramming).

Human iPSC (induced pluripotent stem cells) continuously face a choice between making exact copies of themselves (‘self-renew’), or turn into any human cell type (‘differentiation’), providing great potential for research and therapeutic uses.

Cell death or loss of pluripotency are common in iPSC culturing. Thus, assessing cell state (e.g. good/pluripotent or bad/differentiated) is a critical step in stem cell research, both in academia (to study them) or in biotech (for quality control).

<br/>

* ‘Good’: Colonies with pluripotent cells
* ‘Bad’: Colonies with differentiated cells
* ‘Empty’: Empty wells, no or very few cells

We imaged human iPSC cells on 96-well plates over 2 weeks using Sartorius Incucyte device. For your convenience we provide a training set divided as above in good, bad, empty and test sets with real-life examples.

Images will have single cells from early timepoints dividing to make colonies over time; feel free to take full advantage of cell morphology, colony morphology and/or context features such as how distant cells are to each other over time, etc..

This year, we challenge you to build pipelines that can analyse and assess the pluripotency of iPSC based just on phase microscopy images. The result of this hackathon could lead to more efficient processes in iPSC culturing and analysis.

## Challenges
The CytoData Hackathon 2021: 3 challenges for your quantitative/qualitative minds. Please use our standardised format sheet for reporting your clustering predictions. Evaluations will have two quantitative scores and one qualitative jury prize. 


### Challenge 1: 
Using the dataset in the ‘Training’ folder, cluster the images in the ‘Test 1’ folders correctly into ‘Good’ and ‘Bad’ categories. Teams which clustered the most images correctly will get the highest score.


### Challenge 2a:
How generalisable is your algorithm? Can it assess images independent of the time point on a single image? Please use your algorithm to cluster the images in the ‘Test 2a’ folder. Teams with the most images correctly clustered will get the highest score.


### Challenge 2b:
Can you obtain spatial information from the images? Would you be able to tell which part of the colony is good and which part is bad for the images in our folders? You can start from training test1 and move onto the others too. 


### Challenge 3:
Come up with your own standards to assess the pluripotency of iPSC. Any other bright idea welcome, let your imagination run, the sky's the limit. The aim is to have a feedback loop clustering in good/bad the culture status to be used for quality control.

We have done some preliminary colony segmentation using Cell Profiler. We have not segmented further objects inside each colony. The measurements for colony segmentation can be downloaded here as csv files: [docs.csv](https://bitbio-ext-pheno-hackathon.s3.amazonaws.com/docs_csv.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAQIB6BT2PS6T2VXYB%2F20211006%2Feu-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20211006T134814Z&X-Amz-Expires=604800&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=f4fa777639caf928e59ac689f0cc4ca68a38a34ec3e37fd1f94be4faf213b461). The Cell Profiler pipeline can be found in this main branch as '2021-09-30 incucyte mask processing v1.0.cpproj'. Feel free to use any of the parameters as a starting point to analyse colony pluripotency state: colony area, diameter, circularity, cell distances, cell morphology, any of the above, combined cell profiler features, multidimensional hyperspaces, etc.

Thanks to Cytodata and all scientists in our Cellular Phenotyping team for support. The experiments for this dataset were set up and acquired by Sarah Hussain, Stefan Milde, Fiona Connolly at bit.bio using Sartorius Incucyte device. The dataset was organised with the help from Sanaullah Nazir at bit.bio.
