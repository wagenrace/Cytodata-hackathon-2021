# Ilastic Morphology

Using Ilastic a model is made that splits the cobbelstone, inner good, outer good, debri, and background.
These are not really supported by science but more on what I saw in the pictures.

Next up those results are used to segment the biggest colony and calculated the ratio of these different morphologies.

A simple random forstest makes it into a classifier to finish it up.
